# Ceph Deployment Configuration

## Overview
This configuration is intended for deploying a Ceph cluster using `cephadm`. It sets up the essential components, including monitor (MON) and object storage device (OSD) services. The configuration ensures that the cluster is robust, scalable, and ready for handling distributed storage across multiple nodes. With the use of orchestration commands, it simplifies the deployment and management processes of Ceph.

## Stack & Components
- **Ceph**: Distributed storage system
- **cephadm**: Tool for managing Ceph clusters
- **MONs**: Monitor nodes for cluster coordination and management
- **OSDs**: Object Storage Daemons for storing data
- **mgr**: Management module for monitoring and performance metrics

## Configuration Breakdown

### Package Installation
The script begins with instructions for installing the required packages necessary for deploying the Ceph cluster. This usually includes tools like `cephadm` which is essential for managing the deployment and orchestration of Ceph services.

### MON Setup
This section outlines the configuration for initializing the monitor nodes. It involves commands that create and configure the first monitor instance, ensuring it has the right IP, authentication keys, and network settings.

### OSD Setup
Following the monitor setup, the OSD setup commands create and configure the OSD nodes. These commands handle the setup of storage devices that will be used for data storage in the Ceph cluster, including the formatting and assigning of disks to OSD processes.

### Ceph Bootstrap
In this step, the script includes commands to bootstrap the overall Ceph cluster using `cephadm`. This involves initializing the Ceph management services and ensuring that the cluster is operational and connected.

## Deployment & Usage
1. **Install necessary packages**:
   ```bash
   apt install cephadm
   ```

2. **Bootstrap the Ceph cluster**:
   ```bash
   cephadm bootstrap --mon-ip <MON_IP>
   ```

3. **Add OSDs to the cluster**:
   ```bash
   ceph orch osd create <disk>
   ```

4. **Verify cluster status**:
   ```bash
   ceph -s
   ```

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting
To monitor the health of the Ceph cluster, use the following command:
```bash
ceph -s
```
For checking the status of orchestrated services, run:
```bash
ceph orch ps
```
Additionally, consult logs stored in `/var/log/ceph` for detailed event tracking. 

Common issues may arise from misconfigured network settings or insufficient disk permissions for OSDs. Always ensure that the devices intended for use as OSDs are properly sized and formatted.

## Change / Extend This Setup
To scale the Ceph cluster:
1. **Add more OSDs**:
   Use the command `ceph orch osd create <new_disk>` for each new storage device.
   
2. **Add new MONs**:
   Instructions to create additional monitor nodes typically involve a similar process as the initial MON setup, ensuring they are properly integrated into the cluster configuration.

3. **Update repositories**:
   Regularly update the Ceph deployment by pulling new images and using:
   ```bash
   ceph orch apply osd
   ```
